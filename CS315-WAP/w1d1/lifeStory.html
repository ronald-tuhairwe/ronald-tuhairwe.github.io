<h2>As achild</h2>
<pre>When i was growing up as a child i thought being so bright in class was the best way to
    to win in life.
     And i did everything i could to be the best in class and then later to be suprised in life
     when i got older and found out the students who were the lazzy in the head are the owns now 
     driving the best cars around and hanging out in cool, places without forgetting the fact 
     that they go on vaccation like 3 times a year.
     This life is so confussing and it has no formula 
</pre>
<p>So moral of my life story, its not always about eductation like our parents thought.</p>
<P>The richest guys in the world are not proffesors but....</P>
